        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            We're elevating these prime ground beef burgers with specialty ingredients like our plush, chewy challah buns—an enriched dough (known as brioche) made with additions of milk, eggs, and butter, which give the bread its golden, silky crumb —plus our umami-rich truffle zest seasoning mixed into mayo for a luxe condiment.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz Usda Prime Ground Beef</li>
            <li>2 Challah Buns</li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp Truffle Zest Seasoning (Includes Natural Truffle Flavor and Black Summer Truffle)</li>
            <li>4 oz Mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 oz Fontina Cheese</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>3 oz Radishes</li>
            <li>1 Red Onion</li>
            <li>2 oz Arugula</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Verjus Rouge</li>
            <li>1 bunch Thyme</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Capers</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Dijon Mustard</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Sherry Vinegar</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Wash and dry the fresh produce. Thinly slice the mushrooms. Halve, peel, and thinly slice the onion. Thinly slice the cheese. Halve the buns. Halve the radishes lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. In a bowl, combine the mayonnaise and as much of the truffle zest as you'd like. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced mushrooms in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the sliced onion, capers, and thyme sprigs (if the pan seems dry, add a drizzle of olive oil). Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the verjus (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the liquid has cooked off. Turn off the heat. Carefully discard the thyme sprigs. Transfer to a bowl and cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.

                Place the beef in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Gently mix to incorporate. Form the mixture into two 1/2-inch-thick patties. In the same pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the patties. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until browned. Flip the patties (carefully, as the oil may splatter) and evenly top with the sliced cheese. Loosely cover the pan with foil and cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the patties are browned and cooked through.* Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a work surface. Carefully drain off and discard any excess oil. 
            </li>

                Add the halved buns, cut side down, to the pan of reserved fond (if the pan seems dry, add a drizzle of olive oil). Toast on medium-high 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until lightly browned. Transfer to a work surface. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In a bowl, whisk together the mustard, vinegar, and a drizzle of olive oil until combined. In a separate, large bowl, combine the arugula, sliced radishes, and enough of the dressing to coat (you may have extra); season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Assemble the burgers using the toasted buns, truffle mayo, cooked patties, and cooked mushrooms. Serve the burgers with the salad on the side. Enjoy!
