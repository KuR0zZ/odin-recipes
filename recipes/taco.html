        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Packed inside flour tortillas, slices of Mexican-spiced steak and a juicy tomato-jalapeño salsa find cooling contrast from bright lime sour cream, plus a side of zucchini sprinkled with cotija.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Steaks</li>
            <li>4 oz Grape Tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 Zucchini</li>
            <li>1 oz Sliced Pickled Jalapeño Pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps Grated Cotjia Cheese</li>
            <li>4 Flour Tortillas</li>
            <li>2 Scallions</li>
            <li>1 Lime</li>
            <li>1.4 cup Sour Cream</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Mexican Spice Blend (Ancho Chile Powder, Smoked Paprika, Garlic Powder, Ground Cumin & Dried Mexican Oregano)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                If you prefer to use an oven to warm the tortillas instead of a microwave, preheat the oven to 375°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Halve the tomatoes. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and hollow green tops. Medium dice the zucchini. Halve the lime crosswise. Roughly chop the pepper. Thoroughly wash your hands, knife, and cutting board immediately after handling. In a bowl, combine the sour cream and the juice of 1 lime half. Season with salt and pepper. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In a bowl, combine the halved tomatoes, sliced white bottoms of the scallions, the juice of the remaining lime half, 2 teaspoons of olive oil, and as much of the chopped pepper as you'd like, depending on how spicy you'd like the dish to be. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, at least 10 minutes. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, pat the steaks dry with paper towels; season on all sides with salt, pepper, and half the spice blend. In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned steaks. Cook, turning occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes for medium-rare (125°F), or until browned and cooked to your desired degree of doneness.* Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board; let rest at least 5 minutes.

                In the pan of reserved fond, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the diced zucchini in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Season with salt, pepper, and the remaining spice blend. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Turn off the heat. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If using the microwave, wrap the tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave on high 1 minute, or until heated through. If using the oven, wrap the tortillas in foil and place directly onto an oven rack; warm 7 to 9 minutes, or until heated through. Transfer the warmed tortillas to a work surface and carefully unwrap. 
            </li>

                Find the lines of muscle (or grain) on the rested steaks; slice crosswise against the grain. Assemble the tacos using the warmed tortillas, lime sour cream, sliced steaks, and tomato salsa. Serve the tacos with the cooked zucchini. Garnish with the sliced green tops of the scallions. Garnish the zucchini with the cheese. Enjoy!
