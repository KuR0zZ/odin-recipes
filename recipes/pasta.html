        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Packed inside flour tortillas, slices of Mexican-spiced steak and a juicy tomato-jalapeño salsa find cooling contrast from bright lime sour cream, plus a side of zucchini sprinkled with cotija.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 oz Mafalda Pasta</li>
            <li>4 oz Grape Tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Basil Pesto</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps Mascarpone Cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Crushed Red Pepper Flakes</li>
            <li>2 ears Of Corn</li>
            <li>2 Scallions</li>
            <li>1 oz Sliced Roasted Red Peppers</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Grated Romano Cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Remove any husks and silks from the corn; cut the kernels off the cobs. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and hollow green tops. Halve the tomatoes; place in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Stir to coat. Roughly chop the peppers. 
            </li>

                Add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, 10 to 12 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the corn kernels in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned (be careful, as the corn may pop as it cooks). Add the sliced white bottoms of the scallions and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until softened and combined. Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. 
            </li>

                To the pot of cooked pasta, add the seasoned tomatoes, cooked corn, chopped peppers, pesto, and mascarpone. Stir to thoroughly combine. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Serve the finished pasta garnished with the romano and sliced green tops of the scallions. Enjoy!
